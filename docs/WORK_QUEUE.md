## Sorcerer follow-up

**Status:** DEFERRED_AFTER_BASE_STAGE_6  
**Marked:** 2026-09-10  
**Branch:** dev

Return to Sorcerer after the current all-class translation pass is complete.

Current checkpoint:
- Base Sorcerer Stages 1-6 are complete and deployed.
- Stage 6 spell runtime is already READY; do not redo it.
- Next intended Sorcerer work item is Stage 7: subclass runtime/integration.
- Before Stage 7, re-open `src/rule-templates/CLASS_WORK_STATUS.md` and the Sorcerer authoring/runtime sources, then verify live Supabase parity rather than trusting stale notes.

Resume trigger: `ALL_CLASS_TRANSLATIONS_COMPLETE`.
